# To take advantage of the speed of numpy and apply transformations to the entire image with a single operation
# the arrays need to be the same shape. However, the shapes currently looks like this:
#    - overlay_colors shape:(width, height, 3)  3 color values for each pixel, (red, green, blue)
#    - alpha_channel  shape:(width, height, 1)  1 single alpha value for each pixel
# We will construct an alpha_mask that has the same shape as the overlay_colors by duplicate the alpha channel
# for each color so there is a 1:1 alpha channel for each color channel
alpha_mask = np.dstack((alpha_channel, alpha_channel, alpha_channel))

# The background image is larger than the overlay so we'll take a subsection of the background that matches the
# dimensions of the overlay.
# NOTE: For simplicity, the overlay is applied to the top-left corner of the background(0,0). An x and y offset
# could be used to place the overlay at any position on the background.
